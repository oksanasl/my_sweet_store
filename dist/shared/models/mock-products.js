        description: 'Pineapples, like bananas, are chill-sensitive and should not be stored in the refrigerator. Pineapple is a good source of manganese (91 percent DV in a one cup serving), as well as containing significant amounts of Vitamin C (94 percent DV in a one cup serving) and Vitamin B1 (8 percent DV in a one cup serving). It is also a source of copper and dietary fiber. Pineapple contains a proteolytic enzyme bromelain, which digests food by breaking down protein. Pineapple juice can thus be used as a marinade and tenderizer for meat.',

Riegel (2006) reports that a 100-gram portion of pear fulfills about 9 percent of the recommended daily allowance of vitamin C. Pears are the least allergenic of all fruits. Along with lamb and soya formula, pears form part of the strictest exclusion diet for allergy sufferers.',

        description: 'Mangos are excellent sources of beta-carotene and beta-cryptoxanthin. Both ripe and unripe mangos are good sources of vitamin C. Both vitamins A and C are anti-oxidants that eliminate free radicals in the body and thus reduce the risk of certain cancers. Mangos also contain an enzyme that provide aid in digestion, through breaking down proteins, and enzymes that stimulate metabolism and help with intestinal cleansing. Mangos have various phenols that are considered to have antioxidant and anticancer properties, and help prevent cardiovascular disease. The high iron content in mangos are considered to help anemia and replace iron lost through menstruation and pregnancy. Mangos should always be washed to remove any sap or residue on the skin before handling.',

Coconut water provides an isotonic electrolyte balance, and is a highly nutritious food source. It is used as a refreshing drink throughout the humid tropics and is also used in isotonic sports drinks. Mature fruits have significantly less liquid than young immature coconuts.',

        description: 'In the global functional food industry, pomegranate earns this status of "superfruits" from its abundance of health benefits, such as reducing heart disease, relieving blood pressure, and battling prostate cancer, lymphoma, and diabetes. Providing 40% of an adults daily vitamin C requirement per 100 milliliter serving, pomegranate juice is also a good source of folic acid and antioxidant polyphenols. Juice of the pomegranate has been found effective in reducing heart disease risk factors, including LDL oxidation, macrophage oxidative status, and foam cell formation, all of which are steps in atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The juice may also have antiviral and antibacterial effects against dental plaque.',

Figs also are good source of flavonoids and polyphenols. Figs and other dried fruit were measured for their antioxidant content. A 40 gram portion of dried figs (two medium size figs) produced significant increase in plasma antioxidant capacity.',

        description: 'Kiwifruit is a rich source of vitamins C, A and E. Its potassium content by weight is slightly less than that of a banana. The kiwifruit seed oil contains on average 62 percent alpha-linolenic acid, an omega-3 fatty acid. Kiwifruit is often reported to have mild laxative effects, possibly because of the high level of dietary fiber. Kiwifruit also serves as a natural blood thinner. A recent study found that the consumption of two to three kiwifruit daily for 28 days significantly thinned the blood, thus reducing the risk of clots, and it also lowered potentially blockage-causing fat in the blood. Raw kiwifruit is rich in the protein-dissolving enzyme actinidin, which is commercially useful as a meat tenderizer but can be an allergen for some individuals.',

        description: 'The raw fruit is used to treat constipation and hemorrhoids, and to stop bleeding. As such, it is not a good idea to consume too many persimmons at once—they can induce diarrhea. On the other hand, the cooked fruit is used to treat diarrhea and dysentery. The fruits of some persimmon varieties contain the tannins catechin and gallocatechin, as well as the anti-tumor compounds betulinic acid and shibuol, although the latter may also cause gastrointestinal problems. It is often advised that persimmons should not be eaten with crab meat nor on an empty stomach.',
